Conservation data was downloaded from the UCSC Genome browser.
Files were Conservation Scores and Basewise Conservation Scores (phyloP)
for alignment of 25 nematode genomes with C. elegans genome assembly
WBcel235 for 26 total worms compared.
Conservation data files and intermediate feature comparison files
were not uploaded.

Tissue Codes:
    - 126 is pan-neuronal
    - 127 is muscle
    - 379 is dopaminergic neurons
    - 382 is intestine
    - 433 is serotonergic neurons

top0.01_features_cons.csv is the list of top features (1% most differentialy
expressed), with conservation data columns.

top0.01_features_top0.01phyloP.csv and top0.01_features_top0.01phastCons.csv
are the intersection of features in top0.01_features.csv with the most
conserved features (top 1%) according to phyloP and phastCons datasets.
top0.01_features_top0.01_anyCons is the union of these two files.

top0.01_features_stats.txt gives an overview of frequency of each feature
type in the general dataset and the top0.01_feature dataset.

Files beginning with comparison contain the feature name, feature attribute,
and log 2 fold change expression change in 126v127, 126v382, and 127v382, and
conservation data from PhyloP and phastCons. Files beginning with
comparison_top are subsets of the corresponding comparison file, but contain
only featues in the top0.01_features.csv file (features with padj < 0.01 in
any results file).
Only comparison_ncRNA.csv and comparison_top_ncRNA.csv was uploaded to Github,
but one file exists per gene biotype.

comparison_top_*_comments.txt give comments on the features in the corresponding
comparison csv file. They were generated by viewing genes on Wormbase and the
UCSC genome browser to find possible gene opverlaps.
'separate' indicates the feature has no overlap, 'near'
indicates the feature is less than its length from another feature, 'adj'
indicates the feature is very close or slightly overlapping another feature,
'overlaps' indicates the feature shares base pairs with another feature.
These were only generated for features with few genes (lincRNA, rRNA, snoRNA,
tRNA) and were not uploaded to Github.

top0.01_features_top0.01_anyCons_comments.txt is
top0.01_features_top0.01_anyCons.csv with a new comment column
and an additional column indicating if the feature could be a target of
laboratory study via knockout (y indicates it has no overlaps and does not
play an obviously essential role, m indicates it depends on the base-pair
resolution of the knockout method, n indicates it overlaps another feature
or plays an essential cellular role).

features_to_consider.txt is a list of features for possible wet lab
investigation.
