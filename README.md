# CalarcoLabSummer2021

Code I wrote for my time at Dr. John Calarco's lab
in the summer of 2021, between first and second year
undergraduate.

Working remotely, I analyzed previously collected RNA
read data from *C. elegans* tissue samples to identify
differentially expressed genes. Some of the summary files
have been uploaded, but the focus of this repository is
demonstrating the methods, libraries, and scripts used
rather than the specific conclusions reached.

Work was performed on the Compute Canada Niagara server
with large files and datasets. These cannot be uploaded
to Github, but I have placed files explaining their absence.
The directory structure on Niagara differs from what 
was uploaded here (with many more subdirectories holding
obselete code). This causes inconsistent filepaths in the R files.
